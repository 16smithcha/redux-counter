# Redux Counter - Mini
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevMountain/redux-counter/master/SolutionPicture.png" />

### Setup
To begin, fork and clone this repository. Once it has finished downloading `cd` into the project root and run `npm i` or `yarn` to fetch the project dependencies. After they are fetched run `npm start` and a browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000` displaying a (non-functioning) counter app.

### The plan
Our goal with this mini project is to create a small counter application using React and Redux. Beyond the standard increment and decrement functionality, we also want to implement an undo/redo stack similar to what you see in most text editors.

### Step 1
**Summary**
Right now nothing works! That's because Redux will be handling all of our state management and we haven't wired it up yet. To get started we'll need to install some new dependencies, make our application aware of the Redux store, and connect our `App` component to Redux.

**Instructions**
Install `redux` and `react-redux`, add a dummy reducer function that just returns `{ test: true }` to `src/ducks/counter.js`,  add the Provider component to `index.js`, and connect the `App` component to Redux.

**Detailed Instructions**

Begin by running `npm i redux react-redux --save` to install the required dependencies.

Open up `src/ducks/counter.js` and export default a function named `counter`. Later on this function will be where we manage our application state, but for now let's just have it return an object of `{ test: true }` to make sure everything gets properly connected.

Next, we will need to open up `src/store.js` and import two things: `createStore` from Redux, and the `counter` function written above. To create our application store we need to invoke `createStore` passing in `counter`, be sure to export the result by default. The store we are creating here is really nothing more than a big object that holds our application's state.

After the above is complete we need to make our application aware of the Redux store. Go to `src/index.js` and import `Provider` from `react-redux` as well as the `store` we just created. Wrap the root component (in this case `App`) in the `Provider` component, with `store` as a prop.

Finally, we need to connect `App` to our application's state. To do this we first need to import the aptly named `connect` function from `react-redux`. Then, underneath your `App` component, create a function `mapStateToProps` that takes a parameter `state`. This function will tell `connect` which pieces of state we're interested in. Right now we want all of it, so just return `state`.

Using `connect` we are going to "decorate" our component, which is a fancy way of saying that we are going to let it do things it wasn't able to before, such as access data on state. To do this we need to first create our decorator by invoking `connect` and passing in `mapStateToProps`. Once our decorator is created we need to invoke it and pass in `App`, exporting the result by default.

<summary>Decorator Example</summary>

```jsx
function mapStateToProps( state ) {
	return state;
}
const decorator = connect( mapStateToProps );
const decoratedComponent = decorator( App );
export default decoratedComponent;
```
This is usually shortened to

```jsx
function mapStateToProps( state ) {
	return state;
}
export default connect( mapStateToProps )( App );
```
</details>

Now that we're all wired up, we just need to make sure everything is working! Do this by `console.log`ing `this.props.test` at the top of `App`'s `render` method. You should see an output of `true`.

<summary>**Code Solution**</summary>

```js
// src/ducks/counter.js
export default function counter() {
	return state;
}
```

```js
// src/store.js
import { createStore } from "redux";

import counter from "./ducks/counter";

export default createStore( counter );
```

```jsx
// src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

import "./index.css";

import store from "./store";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
	<Provider store={ store }>
		<App />
	</Provider>
	, document.getElementById( 'root' )
);
```

```jsx
// src/App.js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { connect } from "react-redux";

import "./App.css";

class App extends Component {
	render() {
		console.log( this.props.test );
		return (
			/* lots of jsx */
		);
	}
}

function mapStateToProps( state ) {
	return state;
}

export default connect( mapStateToProps )( App );
```

</details>
