# Redux Counter - Mini
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevMountain/redux-counter/master/SolutionPicture.png" />

### Setup
To begin, fork and clone this repository. Once it has finished downloading `cd` into the project root and run `npm i` or `yarn` to fetch the project dependencies. After they are fetched run `npm start` and a browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000` displaying a (non-functioning) counter app.

### The plan
Our goal with this mini project is to create a small counter application using React and Redux. Beyond the standard increment and decrement functionality, we also want to implement an undo/redo stack similar to what you see in most text editors.

### Step 1
**Summary**
Right now nothing works! That's because Redux will be handling all of our state management and we haven't wired it up yet. To get started we'll need to install some new dependencies, make our application aware of the Redux store, and connect our `App` component to Redux.

**Instructions**
Install `redux` and `react-redux`, add an empty reducer function to `src/ducks/counter.js`,  add the Provider component to `index.js`, and connect the `App` component to Redux.
